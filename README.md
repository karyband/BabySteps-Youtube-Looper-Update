The standalone web app for testing purposes for the BabySteps youtube looper. 

Logan Gittelson and Karina Banda

=== Note === 
This is an update to the standalone web app that was created and can be seen in Logan Gittelson's repository "BabySteps" which I contributed to back in Spring of 2015. The files I have edited and are included in this repository can be found in Logan's repository. I made updates to these files to include a better CSS structure and I fixed a bug when renaming the loops. 

=== Overview ===
Working with University of Rochester PhD Student Logan Gittelson with advisor Professor Philip Guo, we created a Youtube plugin that would allow users to enhance tutorial videos by allowing users to have a loop button integrated into Youtube. Users can have choose the start and end points for a loop if they want want to keep looping through a particular hard step in the tutorial. These loops will also be able to go back to incase a user has to revert back to a specific step that they had picked. For the Youtube looper, the source code can be found here https://github.com/LoganGittelson/BabySteps/tree/master/Youtube%20Looper%20Source. I was responsible for figuring out which sections in Youtube's page we should place our features in. 

My primary responsibility in this research project was the CSS and the Javascript that interacts with the CSS in the standalone web app version that can be used in testing and is what is included here.
